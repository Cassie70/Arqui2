   EBR                2/26            7% used


INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation: The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block. See the device specific data sheet for additional details.
INFO: Design contains pre-loadable EBR during configuration that has a requirement: Since the GSR is disabled for the EBR, make sure write enable and chip enable are inactive during wake-up, so that the pre-loaded initialization values will not be corrupted during wake-up state.
Number of Signals: 553
Number of Connections: 1655

Pin Constraint Summary:
   37 out of 37 pins locked (100% locked).

The following 3 signals are selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    clk_1 (driver: SLICE_66, clk load #: 43)
    clk_0 (driver: SLICE_66, clk load #: 39)
    clk (driver: OSCinst0, clk load #: 26)


The following 5 signals are selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    reset_c (driver: reset, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 4, ce load #: 24)
    n3865 (driver: SLICE_157, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 12, ce load #: 0)
    clk_1_enable_54 (driver: SLICE_204, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 10)
    clk_1_enable_26 (driver: SLICE_204, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 0, ce load #: 10)
    n3888 (driver: SLICE_156, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 10, ce load #: 0)

WARNING - par: Signal "reset_c" is selected to use Secondary clock resources. However, its driver comp "reset" is located at "1", which is not a dedicated pin for connecting to Secondary clock resources. General routing has to be used to route this signal, and it might suffer from excessive delay or skew.
Signal reset_c is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
